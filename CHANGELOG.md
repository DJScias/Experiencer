## 2.0.1
* Fixed reputation module glitchiness when not tracking any reputations.

## 2.0.0
* Legion update
	* The addon has been practically rewritten and previously configured settings are unfortunately lost. You can reconfigure settings by right clicking the Experiencer bar.
	* Keybindings have changed:
		* Control left-click now toggles visiblity.
		* Shift left-click and shift control left-click send current stats to chat.
		* Holding control while using mousewheel will scroll through available bars in following order: experience, reputation, artifact power and honor.
	* Added support for Honor and Artifact Power.
	* You can now choose custom bar color from the options. This color will be shared globally across all of your characters.
	* Options menu has been restructured; now each bar has its own submenu.
	* The visual look of the bar has been improved with flashier animations and more.
	* Added a DataBroker module for the display of current text. Right clicking the DataBroker module will open options menu.
	* Disclaimer: honor and artifact power modules have not actually been tested (because I do not have beta).
